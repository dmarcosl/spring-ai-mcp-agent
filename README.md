# MCP Agent Demo

This project is an agent service built with Java 25, Spring Boot 3.5.6, Spring AI MCP (1.1.0-M3) and WebFlux.

It connects to multiple MCP servers and exposes a REST API that routes user prompts to the most relevant tool automatically using an OpenAI model.

This project is designed to be used together with MCP servers like:

You can use it independently or with this other solution:
